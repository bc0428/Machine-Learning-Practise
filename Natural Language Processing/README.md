Natural-Language-Processing-Practise

My first step into Deep Learning.

Part of the coursework from the course "Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science " on Udemy. The aim is to train the model in classifying reviews of a restaurant, pre-processing techniques such as eliminating stopwords, stemming and case non-preserving were implemented.

The performance of model was finally evaluated with a confusion matrix.
