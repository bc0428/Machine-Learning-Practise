Machine-Learning-Practise-Logistic-Regression-

My first project after learning Machine Learning for 2 weeks

It is always challenging to predict cancer due to its stochastic and multi-factorial nature.

This logistic regression model utilised the "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set" from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The resuting Machine Learning model took into account of several prognostic factors such as Clump Thickness, Uniformity of Cell Size, Uniformity of Cell Shape etc to predict the presence of breast cancer.

At last, confusion matrix and k-fold cross validation was calculated to evaluate the performance of the model.
